# Low-Level LCD Driver for GC9203

[Insert a GIF later]

## 1. Project Description

[cite_start]This is a low-level C++ driver for the GC9203 LCD controller, written entirely from scratch. [cite_start]It is designed to be lightweight and efficient for memory-constrained microcontrollers like the ESP8266. [cite_start]The entire library was developed in the Arduino IDE by meticulously interpreting the official device datasheet and SPI timing diagrams[cite: 11, 12].

## 2. Tech Stack

* [cite_start]**Language:** C++ 
* [cite_start]**Hardware:** ESP8266 [cite: 8][cite_start], GC9203 LCD Controller 
* [cite_start]**Protocol:** SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) 
* **Development:** Arduino IDE
* **Debugging Tools:** Logic Analyzer

## 3. Core Features

* **From-Scratch Implementation:** No third-party graphics libraries were used. All SPI communication and drawing logic are custom-built.
* **Optimized Memory Usage:** Implemented a partial refresh algorithm instead of a full framebuffer. [cite_start]This approach reduced RAM usage by over 60%, making it ideal for devices with limited memory.
* **Graphics Primitives:** A C++ library of essential drawing functions, including `drawLine`, `drawRectangle`, `drawCharacter`, and `fillScreen`.
* **Gamma Correction:** Integrated a Gamma correction curve to ensure accurate color reproduction and proper contrast, preventing washed-out images.

## 4. Challenges & Solutions

This project involved significant hardware-level debugging. My primary challenges were not in software logic, but in making the hardware respond correctly.

### Challenge 1: Hardware Initialization Failure
* **Symptom:** The screen remained blank. Despite sending what I believed were the correct initialization commands from the datasheet, the LCD controller failed to initialize.
* [cite_start]**Solution:** I used a logic analyzer to physically probe and debug the SPI signals (MOSI, MISO, CLK, CS)[cite: 14]. [cite_start]By capturing the traffic, I discovered that my register-level commands [cite: 14] had incorrect timing and formatting. I was able to cross-reference the logic analyzer's output with the datasheet's timing diagrams to correct the initialization sequence and successfully boot the display.

### Challenge 2: Optimizing Refresh Rate (FPS)
* **Symptom:** The FPS was low when drawing complex shapes, but simply increasing the SPI clock speed (MHz) led to signal instability.
* **Solution:** I optimized the driver at the register-command level. Instead of sending single-pixel commands, I re-architected the drawing functions to send data in large, continuous bursts. This dramatically reduced the SPI protocol overhead (the time spent sending commands vs. pixel data), resulting in a significant FPS improvement even at the same stable SPI clock speed.

### Challenge 3: Poor Color Reproduction
* **Symptom:** The default 16-bit colors appeared washed out, and the contrast was poor.
* **Solution:** I researched the non-linear brightness response of LCDs and implemented a Gamma correction lookup table. This table maps linear input color values to the display's native curve, resulting in vibrant, accurate colors and deep contrast.

## 5. How to Build and Use

1.  Clone this repository: `git clone [YOUR_REPO_URL]`
2.  Open the `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
3.  Ensure you have the ESP8266 board manager installed.
4.  Update the pin definitions at the top of the main file to match your wiring:
    ```cpp
    #define PIN_CS   D8
    #define PIN_DC   D4
    #define PIN_RST  D3
    ```
5.  Compile and upload the code to your ESP8266.
